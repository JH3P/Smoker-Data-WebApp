This application graphically visualizes smoker trend data.

To build this project, run 'mvn package' then find the SmokerDataApplication.jar file in the target folder.

Please keep the jar file inside of the target folder as it uses an embedded Jetty server to 
find the necessary files in the exploded WAR.

Use 'java -jar SmokerDataApplication.jar' to run, and then CTRL (or Command) + C to stop the application.

This application is a simple example of taking a JSON file as the backend and serving up data with a 
REST web service using the Jersey framework, and an embedded Jetty server.

The front end was built using the following libraries:
-AngularJS
-Bootstrap
-Angular-NVD3 (D3, NVD3)
-Angular-Resource
